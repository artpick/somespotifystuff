# This is just a pre-commit-msg hook

This is just a **pre-commit-msg** hook which search a song on **Spotify** according to the seven digits of the _sha1_ code generated from the current date or form the _sha1_ retreived form the -C command.

The main goal was: 
* Create a git hook
* Use Python
* Use Spotify API
